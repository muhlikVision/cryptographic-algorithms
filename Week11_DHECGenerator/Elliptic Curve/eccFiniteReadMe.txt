ECC_Finite MATLAB Function Explanation:

1. Function Definition:
   - The function is named 'ECC_Finite' and uses varargin to accept a variable number of input parameters. It plots an elliptic curve over a finite field.

2. Setting Default Curve Parameters:
   - Default values are set for the elliptic curve coefficients 'a' and 'b', the prime number 'p', and the range ('low' to 'high') and number of points ('points') for the plot.

3. Overriding Default Values with User Inputs:
   - The function checks the number of input arguments (nargin) and overrides the default values if the user has provided inputs.

4. Generating a Grid of Points:
   - A grid of x and y values is created using meshgrid, with x and y values ranging from 'low' to 'high' and consisting of 'points' number of points along each dimension.

5. Applying the Elliptic Curve Equation in a Finite Field:
   - The contour function is used to find the level curve where the elliptic curve equation holds true modulo 'p'. The equation used is mod(y^2, p) - mod(x^3 - ax - b, p) = 0.

6. Extracting Coordinates from the Contour Plot:
   - The coordinates of the contour line are extracted using getContourLineCoordinates, which interprets the contour matrix 'cm' returned by the contour function.

7. Storing the Coordinates:
   - The coordinates are stored in a table and then converted into an array format. 'X' and 'Y' represent the x and y coordinates of points on the elliptic curve.

This function effectively computes and visualizes the points that lie on the elliptic curve defined over a finite field specified by the prime number 'p'.
